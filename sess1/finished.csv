With U.S. bond yields at historic lows and Europe offering negative yields, a 2.5% yield on stocks seemed like a decent income option for many. Fast-forward to today, and the situation has flipped: investors now have access to 5% or more yields with effectively no risk.Hence, to warrant assuming additional risk with income stocks, t",5748,Income Investing Gold: 3 Stocks Offering 6% Dividend Yields - Stock Trade Market,,,,wp_seo,post
